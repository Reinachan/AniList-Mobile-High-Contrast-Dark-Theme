# AniList-Mobile-High-Contrast-Dark-Theme
High-contrast dark-theme to use as a bookmarklet on mobile

## Instructions
1. Open the file called [DarkThemeURI](/DarkThemeURI) and copy the content of the file.
2. Make a new bookmark on your phone
3. Edit the url for that bookmark and paste the content you just copied in step 1.
4. Open the bookmarklet when using AniList

## Android Users
While the method above should work on both iOS and Android, Android users have a better option than this. I recommend installing it as a userstyle instead.
1. Install a browser that supports extensions
  - [Kiwi Browser](https://kiwibrowser.com/)
  - [Yandex Browser](https://browser.yandex.com/mobile/)
2. Install the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en-GB) extension
3. Add [this UserCSS](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/416013-anilist-high-contrast-dark-theme)

## Disclaimer
The bookmarklet method requires you to run the bookmarklet every single time you re-open or reload the site. As AniList is a webapp, it won't auto-reload unless the token expire, so you should usually be fine.

I do not have an Android device to test either of these methods on. I'm just assuming the above methods will work on one.
